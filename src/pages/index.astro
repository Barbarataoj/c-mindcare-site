    <h2>How C-Mind Works</h2>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <div class="card">
        <strong>1. Structured engagement</strong>
        <p class="muted">
          Users interact with guided, AI-assisted conversations designed
          around evidence-based therapeutic principles.

      <div class="card">
        <strong>2. Adaptive support</strong>
        <p class="muted">
          Interactions adapt over time based on user needs, preferences,
          and readiness for change.

        <strong>3. Safety-first escalation</strong>
        <p class="muted">
          Human-in-the-loop safeguards support appropriate escalation to
          clinical or human care when needed.
